This project is a multiplayer game that communicates commands via sockets. It runs like a general animation-based MVC game on the client end, but is constantly communicating user input to the other users by wrapping commands, actions, and data into strings and transmitting them to a server which redistributes the information as needed. So the modules required were sockets of course but also threading to handle the constant input over sockets, the Queue module to communicate between the threads, and Tkinter as the graphics engine on the client end. All of those modules come with Python 3 so no installation should be required beyond python3. As a multiplayer game, there are two files that are involved in the game: the client and server. To run the game, one user must run the server on their computer and replace the IP address on line 19 of the tankServer code with their computer’s current IP. All people playing the game will want to run the client code but also update the IP address with the IP of the person who is running the server on their computer. If you wish to run multiple clients on the same computer, run the server through a text editor or IDE but use terminal/command to run as many instances of the client code. But again remember to update IP addresses so that they match your computers current address.
